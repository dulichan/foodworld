	<h3>Credit Card Safety Guarantee </h3>

	We use the latest encryption technology to protect your personal data, including your credit card information to assure that every transaction you make at Foodworld.lk will be safe. Shopping at Foodworld.lk is safer than using your credit card at your local restaurant, gas station, hotel or store. 

	Also, our mall-wide shopping cart feature allows you to easily purchase items from multiple stores while only having to check out one time. This is a great convenience feature that simplifies online shopping. However, each time that you check out, you will be asked to input your credit card information. The reason we request your credit card information each time you check out is because we do not store your credit card information. We do not believe it is in your best interest for ANY company to store your personal credit card information for retail purchases.

	<h3>Shopper Guarantee</h3>

	Foodworld.lk selects merchants from the catering and food industries to be located within our mall. Many of our participating merchants are well known and trusted brands that have decades-long histories of providing consumers with quality products, excellent value and world-class customer service. Others are less well known but offer high quality, hard-to-find items. When you purchase an item in Foodworld.lk that transaction is between you and our merchant tenant. Our merchants are responsible for order fulfillment and each of them have their own delivery, return and warranty policy. We encourage each of them to list these policies on the navigation bar in their webstore. If you have any questions before or after you have placed an order that are not answered clearly in their webstore, please contact the merchant directly.

	Despite everyone's best efforts, we realize there may be times when a mistake is made and your merchandise isn't delivered promptly or the merchandise that is delivered isn't exactly what you ordered. In this type of situation, please contact the merchant directly at the contact information listed in their webstore to pursue a resolution. If a resolution is not met promptly, please contact Foodworld.lk and we will intercede on your behalf to attempt a resolution with the merchant. For more information about our shopper guarantee, please contact us. 


	<h3>Privacy Guarantee</h3>

	Foodworld.lk knows that you are concerned about how your personal information is used and shared, and we respect the importance of maintaining the privacy of our visitors and members. In short, we agree not to release your individual personal information to any 3rd party without your expressed permission. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more information.
